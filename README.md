# Hindsight

An always-listening audio buffer for a Raspberry Pi.

It captures a USB audio interface into a memory ring, continuously. Pressing
**Capture** in the web UI writes the last 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 7 minutes or
the whole ring to disk. Nothing touches disk until you ask.

It exists because the take you want is the one you already played.

## Features

- **Waveform page** — open any take to zoom and scrub it, drag to pan, press and hold then drag to mark out a region, hear it loop, flag moments, share the region as an MP3 from your phone, or export it as a new take with declick fades.
- **Rising notes** — press Play and the take's MIDI plays out on a keyboard: every note grows out of its key and rises away, drums pop out of their pads. On a tablet it fills the right of the take page beside the wave and lanes; on a phone it opens from the Notes button in the header. Chips mute a track in the view, and the speed chip plays the preview at ½× or 2× with the pitch kept.
- **MIDI beside every take** — every USB MIDI device that enumerates is read, and a save writes a Standard MIDI File next to the WAV: one track per device and channel, on the take's timeline to within a couple of milliseconds, with a tempo map from the clock so the notes land on the DAW grid. Drop both at the project start and they line up.

## Try it

The demo runs the whole application — UI, meters, buffer ribbon, capture,
takes — against a synthetic 96 BPM loop. No audio interface, no PortAudio, no
cgo. Go 1.23 or newer is the only requirement.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabeduke/hindsight && cd hindsight
RING_SECONDS=120 CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/hindsight --demo
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:5000>.

`CGO_ENABLED=0` is what makes that true. Without it Go links the real PortAudio
binding, which needs the C library present — so on a machine that does not have
it the build fails before the demo ever starts.

`RING_SECONDS=120` deliberately shrinks the ring for the demo. The default is
the Pi-sized `900`, which allocates about 1.4 GB up front and takes fifteen
real minutes to fill — so the buffer ribbon would sit almost empty for the
whole time you were looking at it.

**On macOS, port 5000 is usually taken** by ControlCenter's AirPlay Receiver,
and you get `http: listen tcp :5000: bind: address already in use`. Pick
another port:

```bash
RING_SECONDS=120 PORT=5173 CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./cmd/hindsight --demo
```

Takes are written to `~/hindsight/jam_saves` unless you set `OUTPUT_DIR`. If
`ffmpeg` is not on your `PATH` the audio still saves, but the takes list has no
mp3 preview to play or draw.

## Install on a Raspberry Pi

Every merge to `main` publishes an arm64 tarball. Download it, check it,
unpack it, run the installer. (These URLs resolve once the repository is
renamed to `hindsight`; until then, use the current repository's releases
page.)

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/gabeduke/hindsight/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS
tarball=$(awk '{print $2}' SHA256SUMS)
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/gabeduke/hindsight/releases/latest/download/$tarball"
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
tar xzf "$tarball"
cd "${tarball%.tar.gz}"
./install.sh
```

The installer adds the runtime packages, puts the binary and UI under
`~/hindsight`, installs a systemd **user** service and enables lingering so it
keeps running after you log out. It has not yet been run end to end on a real
Pi — [docs/install-raspberry-pi.md](docs/install-raspberry-pi.md) walks through
it and says what to check.

## Hardware

- A Raspberry Pi 5. 8 GB if you want the default 15-minute ring; the buffer is
  uncompressed and lives in RAM.
- A USB audio interface whose master output lands on a known channel pair.

Developed against a Teenage Engineering EP-136, but nothing here is specific to
it: anything PortAudio enumerates should work. The two knobs are `DEVICE_MATCH`
(a substring of the device name) and `SAVE_CHANNELS` (which pair is the
master).

If the interface also sends MIDI clock, Hindsight reads it and stamps each take
with the tempo it measured. That is a starting point you can edit, not a fact.
Any other class-compliant USB MIDI device plugged into the Pi is read too, and
what it sent during a take is written beside the take as a `.mid`.

## How it works

```
USB audio interface (8ch)
   │  PortAudio callback — computes level bins, hands blocks off, never blocks
   ▼
free/filled block pool ──► ring writer goroutine ──► Ring (RING_SECONDS)
   │                                                   │
   │ Levels (10ms min/max/RMS bins)                    │ Snapshot(seconds)
   ▼                                                   ▼
WebSocket /api/live ──► live waveform + meters    WAV ─┬─► mp3 preview
                                                       └─► .peaks.json
```

The audio callback only computes levels and hands the block to a pooled
channel. A single writer goroutine owns the ring, so a capture can memcpy a
snapshot out under a mutex without ever stalling the device.

The levels also feed an envelope of the whole ring, which is what the buffer
ribbon across the top of the page draws. Its time axis is logarithmic, so the
recent end is legible and the old end still fits: you can see where in the last
fifteen minutes something was happening before deciding how much to keep.

## Configuration

Everything is environment driven. Copy `deploy/hindsight.env.example` to
`~/hindsight/hindsight.env`; the four most people touch are:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RING_SECONDS` | `900` | Buffer length, and the longest possible capture. Dominates RAM: `seconds × 48000 × channels × 4` bytes |
| `SAVE_CHANNELS` | `1,2` | 1-indexed pair carrying the stereo master |
| `DEVICE_MATCH` | `EP-136` | Substring match on the PortAudio device name |
| `MAX_SAVES` | `0` | Prune the oldest takes beyond this count; `0` disables |
| `MIDI_CLOCK_DEVICE` | *(`DEVICE_MATCH`)* | Which device's MIDI clock is the tempo for the `.mid`'s grid |

Every variable, with the reasoning behind the defaults, is in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## On a phone

![Hindsight on a tablet in landscape](docs/images/tablet.png)

The UI is built for a tablet propped next to the gear, and works down to a
phone. On **iOS**, Share → Add to Home Screen gives a real standalone app over
plain HTTP. **Android** will only offer a full install over HTTPS — as will
service workers, which do not register in an insecure context at all. The
install guide covers putting the Pi on an HTTPS name with `tailscale serve`.
