# plus 30 journal lines, which points at everything except the real cause. Run
# the binary once and say so plainly instead. release.yml runs the same check
# on the build side.
#

# against libportaudio2 -- and before the migration below, so a failure here
# does not leave the machine with the old service already stopped.
