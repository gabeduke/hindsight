# The bar

The bar (`#np`, `css/bar.css`, `lib/bar/`) is the one transport, the same
object in both rooms and the same shape on Open (`wave.html`), so **▶ never
moves**: not between rooms, nor between the tape, a take and the feed
(J1.13 measures it at 800, 1024 and 1280 and fails past 2 px, or on a
sideways scroll).

- **Five zones in a row, and the strip under them**, each a named slot in
  the markup (`data-slot`; `lib/bar/slots.js` `SLOTS`): the **deck** (the
  reels and the display), the **transport** (|◀ ▶ ●, with ↺ 5 s in ●'s
  place for a take, the feed, or the tape away from the Studio), the
  **verb** (Catch and its ▾ for the tape in the Studio; GRAB for the feed),
  the **modes** (⟲ Loop or Repeat, the metronome) and the **end** (⏏,
  Open ›, ✎ for a take), laid out first so nothing pushes it off. Every key
  is in the markup, in its slot; a script that adds to the bar puts it in
  a slot by name (`putIn`), never after whatever was appended last.
- **What shows is said positively.** Each key lists in `data-for` the
  sources it is for (`tape`, `studio` = the tape in the Studio, `away` = the
  tape anywhere else, `take`, `feed`) and in `data-mini` those it stays for
  in the phone's mini player; one rule in `css/bar.css` shows each source's
  keys, and a key's `display` is set nowhere else. No `:not()` lists and no
  `!important` (`shape.test.js`). A key a script hides by `hidden` (⏏ with
  no tape) stays hidden.
- **Its widths are its own**: a container query on its first row
  (`.np-row-1`, never `.np` or the dock, whose fixed descendants a container
  would hold). The deck's width hangs on the row's width alone
  (`--deck-w`, from `100cqi`), so ▶ stands at one x whatever the bar
  holds: from 600 px the zones are one row (the reels go under 960), from
  960 the deck is 352 at 1024 and grows to 768, and from 1180 the display
  says everything in full. Under 600 (the phone's player pulled up) the
  zones stack. The phone's mini player is `data-size="mini"`: its window,
  |◀ ▶, and a tail one width for every source.
- **Its height is measured** (`measureBar`: one `ResizeObserver` writing
  `--np-h` on the root), never written into the CSS; every reader has its
  `0px` fallback.
- **The display says what plays** (`lib/bar/display.js`): where it is, then
  three keys on the LCD, each a value over its legend: the tempo (in the
  Studio, with the tape, the tempo menu; elsewhere a readout), the source
  (TAPE, FEED or the take's name; `source-menu.js`: the tape, the live
  feed, the last few takes, Go to the shelf) and where it plays (JAM ROOM,
  PHONE, BOTH for the tape; THIS TABLET, THIS PHONE or THIS COMPUTER for a
  take or the feed; the output sheet). Each value has a short form and a
  long one, for the widest bar.
- **It folds by its grabber** (`lib/bar/fold.js`), a pill on a lip above its
  top edge: a tap toggles, a drag down folds, a drag up unfolds, and it
  slides by a FLIP on the lid spring (a transform, never a height a frame).
  Folded it is one row of 44 px keys, `body.np-fold`, kept for the visit. On
  a phone the grabber is the player's, and puts it away. ▾ only ever opens
  a menu.
