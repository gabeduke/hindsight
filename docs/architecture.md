# Architecture

One Go binary. It opens an audio device, keeps the last `RING_SECONDS` in RAM,
and serves a small vanilla-JS UI. No database, no message broker, no build
step for the frontend.

## The callback never blocks

This is the constraint everything else is arranged around. A PortAudio input
callback that takes too long drops audio, and dropped audio in a dashcam is the
one failure that cannot be repaired afterwards.

So the callback does two cheap things: it accumulates 10 ms min/max/RMS level
bins, and it hands the block to a pooled channel. It never touches the ring, it
never allocates, and it never waits on a lock a slow consumer might hold.

A single writer goroutine owns the ring. Because it is the only writer, a
capture can take the ring's mutex and memcpy a snapshot out — 1.3 GB at the
default settings — without the device ever stalling. The block pool is 64
blocks deep, several seconds of slack at 2048 frames per block, which is what
absorbs the pause while that copy happens.

If the callback stops arriving for two seconds, capture is declared unhealthy
and the supervisor restarts it, backing off from 1 s to 15 s between attempts.

### PortAudio only enumerates once

`Pa_Initialize` builds the device list and never rescans it. An interface that
is powered off therefore stays in that list forever, pointing at an ALSA card
index that no longer exists, and every open attempt fails with "Illegal
combination of I/O devices".

Terminating and re-initialising PortAudio is the only way to see hardware that
appeared or disappeared after start-up. That is what `paLifecycle.Rescan` is
for, and it is why unplugging the interface mid-session and plugging it back in
recovers on its own.

### Input latency

`portaudio.LowLatencyParameters` asks a USB device for a deadline it cannot
meet, and PortAudio then busy-polls — 84% of a core on this Pi, continuously.
A ring buffer has no latency requirement, so `INPUT_LATENCY_MS` is set
explicitly and generously and the draw is about 1%. See "Why
`INPUT_LATENCY_MS` is not small" in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## The `Source` seam

`audio.Source` is the interface between the capture supervisor and whatever is
producing samples:

```go
type Source interface {
	Open(sink func([]int32)) (name string, err error)
	Close()
	Reset() error
	Shutdown() error
}
```

It exists for two reasons. The supervision logic — restart backoff, staleness
watchdog, block pool — is written once and shared. And every PortAudio symbol
sits behind a `//go:build cgo` tag, so `CGO_ENABLED=0` still compiles and still
runs.

There are two implementations. `deviceSource` is the real interface.
`demoSource` generates a 96 BPM loop that is meant to look like music: an 8-bar
arc, hats, real dynamics. A screenshot of a flat sine would tell a reader
nothing about what the meters, the ribbon or a take actually look like.

The demo is derived from a monotonic sample counter rather than the wall clock,
so the waveform is identical run to run and screenshots are reproducible. It is
what makes `--demo` a genuine test of the whole application rather than a stub:
the same ring, the same saver, the same UI.

## The envelope, and why it is server-side

The buffer ribbon draws the amplitude of the entire ring, on a logarithmic time
axis, at one byte per 10 ms bin.

It has to live on the server. A browser-side ring only fills while the page is
open, and this is something you open *after* the moment — the whole point is to
see what happened while nobody was watching.

The axis is logarithmic because the recent end is where decisions are made, and
a linear 15-minute ribbon gives the last 30 seconds three pixels.
`EdgeSeconds = 10` sets how much width the recent end gets; at 1 s the last 30
seconds took half the ribbon, which is far more than that window needs.

Bins store peak, dB-coded, never mean: a peak survives downsampling where a
mean washes out, and linear amplitude would make everything below about
−20 dBFS look like silence.

## The ffmpeg trap

Previews are built with an explicit channel map, and the reason is worth
keeping:

```
ffmpeg -i take.wav -ac 2 out.mp3      # wrong
```

On an 8-channel file, a bare `-ac 2` makes ffmpeg assume a 7.1 layout. It folds
channel 3 into a mono centre and discards channel 4 entirely as LFE. That is
exactly what made previews sound wrong.

`makePreview` in `internal/audio/save.go` builds a `pan` filter naming the
`SAVE_CHANNELS` indices instead, so the preview is the same pair as the take.
The encode runs under `nice -n 10` so it never competes with the audio thread,
and writes to a `.tmp` before renaming, so a half-encoded mp3 is never visible
to the UI.

## MIDI

Two things happen with MIDI. Each take is stamped with the tempo measured
over its own window, as before; and everything every connected instrument
sent during the window is written beside the take as a Standard MIDI File,
placed on the take's timeline to within a couple of milliseconds, with a
tempo map so the notes sit on the DAW's grid. The design is in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-midi-capture-design.md`.

### Every port, no cgo

A watcher polls `/dev/snd` every two seconds for `midiC*D*` nodes and opens
each one it has not seen in its own reader goroutine, named from
`/proc/asound/cards`. That is the no-cgo stand-in for an ALSA sequencer
`System:announce` subscription, and it gives the same result: anything
class-compliant that enumerates gets read, devices come and go mid-session,
and a device that enumerates on USB without ever exposing a MIDI port — the
Orchid, connected before it finished booting — is simply never seen. Device
ids are never reused within a run, so an event recorded under a device that
has since been unplugged can still be named at save time.

Not finding any device is a normal state, not a failure — everything is
frequently unplugged, and a Mac has no `/proc/asound` at all.

`MIDI_DEVICES` and `MIDI_IGNORE` filter the set; `MIDI_CLOCK_DEVICE` picks
whose clock is the tempo source, and only that device's pulses reach the
tempo path. It defaults to `DEVICE_MATCH` so a rig where the EP is the only
clock changes nothing.

Each reader timestamps once per `read(2)` return, with `time.Now()`'s
monotonic reading, and feeds a parser that assembles complete messages —
running status, realtime bytes tested first so a clock pulse inside a note-on
disturbs nothing, SysEx skipped and counted. Channel messages and transport
go to a bounded ring of 16-byte events; clock pulses go to the tempo ring
and are not stored per event, since at 24 a beat from every device they would
be most of the traffic and none of the content.

**`internal/audio` does not import `internal/midi`.** The saver takes a
`TempoSource` and a `MIDIExporter` interface, each called inside a `recover`
after the WAV is on disk, so no MIDI failure — missing device, parse error,
third-party panic — can cost a recording. The worst case is a take with no
BPM and no `.mid`.

### The clock bridge

The plan called for an ALSA `audio_htstamp` anchor taken once at stream
start. PortAudio does not expose one, and a single anchor would be wrong
anyway: the interface's crystal and the Pi's clock disagree by the same
±50–100 ppm the plan warns about for two audio devices, so an anchor at
stream start is 45–90 ms out by the end of a 15-minute ring.

Instead, the delivery path records a `(monotonic ns, ring frame)` pair for
every block it hands to the ring writer — with `TryLock`, so it never waits
on a reader; a dropped block advances neither the frame count nor the history,
so the pairs stay a true account of what the ring holds. A MIDI timestamp
becomes a frame by a local least-squares fit over the pairs that bracket it
(±16, about 0.7 s each side), which removes callback-scheduling jitter and
tracks the drift rather than assuming it away. A gap of more than two seconds
between pairs is a dropout, and a moment inside it maps to the frame the ring
was at when the gap began. PortAudio's reported input latency is applied so a
moment maps to the frame that was *being converted* then, not the one that
had just been handed over.

What remains after that is the instrument's own latency and the cable, a
constant of a few milliseconds that `MIDI_LATENCY_MS` holds and
`scripts/midi-calibrate.py` measures. Against the demo, whose MIDI is derived
from the same frame counter as its audio, the script's median reads within a
couple of milliseconds of zero.

### The tempo map, and why takes start on a downbeat

The clock device's pulses define the beat: 24 pulses a quarter, 40 ticks a
pulse at PPQ 960. Pulses are grouped into segments of constant tempo, each
extended for as long as every pulse in it stays within 2 ms of the straight
line between its ends, so a steady clock yields a handful of tempo events and
a ritardando yields more, and converting any tick back to seconds lands within
2 ms of the real moment either way. Stretches with no clock are written at
120 BPM and the manifest says so.

A DAW's bar 1 is tick 0, and an audio file dropped at the project start
begins there. A take that begins mid-bar therefore cannot sit on the grid: its
first downbeat would have to be reached through a lead-in at an absurd tempo,
which DAWs clamp, shifting everything after. So with `MIDI_SNAP_BARS` on, a
save asks the exporter for the last downbeat the ring still holds — a pulse
whose index since the last MIDI Start is a whole number of bars — and starts
the take there, trimming the snapshot to the exact frame. The take is up to
one bar longer than asked for, and every bar line in the `.mid` is true. The
downbeat is also written into the take's sidecar so the waveform page's grid
agrees with the DAW. Without a Start in living memory the phase is unknown,
nothing moves, and the file's bars are aligned to its first pulse by
convention, flagged in the manifest.

Two details that were learned the expensive way:

- **The backlog is dropped.** ALSA starts buffering clock the moment the device
  node appears, and hands the whole backlog over in the reader's first read.
  Those pulses share a handful of arrival times, and the near-zero intervals
  between them drag the rolling median far above the real tempo — three seconds
  after a replug, 223.3 BPM against a true 120. The first 150 ms after opening
  is therefore thrown away.
- **The EP's tempo is a guess, not ground truth.** The EP has no sequencer at
  all. It runs an on-device algorithm that *infers* a tempo and transmits that
  as clock, so there is no project tempo on the wire to be right or wrong
  about. One idle window read 129.87 BPM, rock-steady, against a project set
  to 92; another held 100.67 through a completely silent room; a power cycle
  reset it to 120. Stability is not evidence of correctness, which is the
  whole argument for the BPM field being editable in the takes list — and for
  pointing `MIDI_CLOCK_DEVICE` at a real sequencer once one is on the Pi.

In demo mode a synthetic sequencer plays along with the loop — clock, a
Start, the kick, hat and bass as notes — through the same event ring and
exporter, so `--demo` writes a real `.mid` and the whole path runs with no
hardware. Its tempo tile reads the estimator against that clock rather than a
constant, which is why it says 96.0 and not exactly 96.

## The UI

Mobile-first, no build step, no npm, no framework. Vanilla ES modules plus a
vendored copy of WaveSurfer.js for scrubbing takes.

It is served with `http.FileServer` straight from disk on every request, which
is why `./deploy.sh --static` can push a CSS change in about a second with no
rebuild and no restart. Anything served with an `.html`, `.js`, `.css` or
`.json` extension is sent `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so the browser revalidates
it and a redeploy is picked up on reload. Nothing here is fingerprinted, so
that includes the vendored WaveSurfer copy; the icons carry no explicit
directive and fall through to `http.FileServer`'s ETag and `Last-Modified`
handling.

The takes list is polled every five seconds and guarded by the `/api/jams`
ETag, so an unchanged list does not re-render and interrupt a playing preview.

Service-worker registration and the screen wake lock are both guarded on
`window.isSecureContext`, so they switch themselves on if the Pi is ever given
an HTTPS name and stay quiet otherwise.

### The waveform page

`web/static/lib/wave/` is seven modules: `geometry` (pure pixel/frame math,
node-tested), `tiles` (fetches and caches `/api/peaks` ranges), `overview`
(the strip above the main waveform — drag, tap and double-tap-to-fit
navigation, node-tested), `view` (canvas rendering and gestures: one-finger
drag selects a region, which always loops; wheel/pinch/two-finger zoom and
pan), `clock` (playback position), `share` (MP3 sniffing and the
share-sheet/download fallback for a rendered region, node-tested), and `page`
(wiring). It is backed by four endpoints: `GET /api/peaks?file=&from=&to=&buckets=`
for on-demand ranges, `POST /api/cut?file=` to export a region as a new take
with declick fades, `GET /api/slice?file=&from=&to=` to audition a region
before cutting it, and `GET /api/render?file=&from=&to=` to stream an MP3 of
the region through ffmpeg for the share sheet.
